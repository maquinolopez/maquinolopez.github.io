# Marco Antonio Aquino-Lopez's Personal Website

## About Me

Originally from Oaxaca, Mexico, I'm Marco Antonio Aquino-Lopez - a numbers guy through and through. I've always loved solving complex quantitative problems, which led me to pursue degrees in math and statistics.

I earned my PhD from Queen's University Belfast, conducting research on Bayesian statistics for paleoclimate age-depth modelling. My work aims to improve uncertainty quantification in techniques like radiocarbon and lead-210 dating. I'm also heavily interested in age-depth modeling approaches.

My current focus is on quantifying uncertainty in the alignment of paleoclimate records. Now a research associate at the University of Cambridge, I get to spend my days immersed in the numerical models and analysis I'm passionate about.

Outside of work, you can find me enjoying nature walks, learning new skills like photography, or playing strategy board games.

Though my career has taken me from Mexico to the UK, that desire to dig into multifaceted quantitative questions has remained constant. I'm excited to see what new statistical challenges my research will uncover next.
