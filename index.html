Aquino-Lopez’s Personal Website</h1>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Originally from Oaxaca, Mexico, I’m Marco Antonio Aquino-Lopez - a
numbers guy through and through. I’ve always loved solving complex
quantitative problems, which led me to pursue degrees in math and
statistics.</p>
<p>I earned my PhD from Queen’s University Belfast, conducting research
on Bayesian statistics for paleoclimate age-depth modelling. My work
aims to improve uncertainty quantification in techniques like
radiocarbon and lead-210 dating. I’m also heavily interested in
age-depth modeling approaches.</p>
<p>My current focus is on quantifying uncertainty in the alignment of
paleoclimate records. Now a research associate at the University of
Cambridge, I get to spend my days immersed in the numerical models and
analysis I’m passionate about.</p>
<p>Outside of work, you can find me enjoying nature walks, learning new
skills like photography, or playing strategy board games.</p>
<p>Though my career has taken me from Mexico to the UK, that desire to
dig into multifaceted quantitative questions has remained constant. I’m
excited to see what new statistical challenges my research will uncover
next.</p>
